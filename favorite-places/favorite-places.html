    <h1>My favorite places!</h1>
    <p>These are the places I could go at any point in time and I would be happy.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Home</strong>
        <p>My home is where I can relax at any time but also a place where I can be very productive (depending on the day). Puyallup has a small town feel with a farmers market every week and a strong sense of community.</p>
        <p>Here is a nice and unformative<a href="www.ci.puyallup.wa.us/"> page</a> about my town.</p>

      </li>
      <li><strong>Coffee Shops</strong>
        <p>Coffee Shops always have the coziest atmospheres where I can get work done, meet with friends, or just relax.</p>
        <p>Here is one of my <a href="5stonescoffeeco.com/"> favorite coffee shops</a>.</p>

      <li><strong>Outside</strong>
        <p>Western Washington is such a great place to live if you love the outdoors. There are so many things to do: hiking, swimming, skiing in the winter, or simply just walking.</p?>
        <p>Here is a <a href="www.experiencewa.com/wa/outdoor-activities"> wonderful website </a>that shares all of Washington's greatest outdoor attractions.</p>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>In order of places listed above, here are my greatest fears in relation to my favorite places:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>I will get locked out of my house.</li>
        <li>There will be a big spider that I can't reach and then it will be gone when I get someone to help.</li>
        <li>The coffee shop will run out of coffee.</li>
        <li>I will buy a cup of coffee and immedietly spill it all over me and have to buy another cup.</li>
        <li>I will be hiking Mt. Rainer when it erupts.</li>
        <li>All the flowers will die.</li>
      </ol>
    <p><strong>Thank you <em>so</em> much for reading about my <em>favorite<em> places! I hope you all find joys in the simple parts of life and your worst fears never come true.</strong></p>
